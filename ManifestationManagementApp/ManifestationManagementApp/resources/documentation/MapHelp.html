    <p>
        This page allows you to show locations for added manifestations on a map.
        You can choose between four maps of Novi Sad. Novi Sad map is the main map
        that displays all manifestations that have assigned locations. Other three maps:
        Stari grad, Detelinara and Liman show manifestations for the according area of Novi Sad.
        Available manifestations are shown in the panel on the letf side. These are
        eather manifestations thet have not boeen added to the maps yet, or manifestation
        that are not displayed on the chosen map but have their locations set on another map. 
        This panel can be hidden to get an 
        unobstructed view of the map. You can set a manifestations location by draging it
        from the side panel and dropping it on the map. You can also display only certain
        manifestations by filtering.
    </p>

    <h1>Drag and drop</h1>
    <p>
        You can place manifestations on the chosen map by dragging it from the side panel
        and dropping it on the map surface. The map displays manifestation icons on given locations.
        Hovering over the manifestation icon will display the manifestation name in a tooltip.
        You can also change the location of a manifestation on the map by draging its icon and
        dropping it onto a different location. The changes you make will affect all of the maps.
        When adding multiple manifestations on a map  overlaping is not allowed. If you try to 
        add a manifestation that is already placed on a different location (on another map)
        you will be prompted to confirm changing the manifestations location. Right-clicking a
        manifestaton icon on the map will open a menu that allows you to edit the manifestation,
        remove it from all maps or delete the manifestation entirely.
    </p>

    <h1>Filtering manifestations</h1>
    <p>
        You can easily display only certain manifestations by performing a filter. Enter a part or
        full manifestation id or name in the filter field at the top right part of the page and
        press Enter or click the "Filter" button. Only the manifestations that contain the given input
        in their id or name will be displayed on the map or in the side panel. Filtering is case sensitive.
